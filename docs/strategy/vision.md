# Product Vision

## Target Customer

Product managers, development teams, and stakeholders who manage requirements in Airtable and need better ways to understand, track, and communicate project status.

## Customer Problem

Airtable's table-based interface hides the relationships and structure within requirements data:
- Connections between requirements are difficult to see in flat table views
- Tracking completion status across the system requires manual effort
- Communicating requirements and progress to stakeholders is cumbersome
- Navigating and understanding the full requirements landscape takes too long

## Value Proposition

Transform Airtable requirements data into clear, interactive visualizations that make project status and structure immediately understandable.

## Key Benefits

- **Visual clarity**: See complex requirements as intuitive sunburst diagrams, tree views, and network graphs instead of spreadsheet rows
- **Progress visibility**: Instantly understand what's done vs pending across the entire system
- **Real-time sync**: Always reflects the current state of your Airtable data without manual updates
- **Shareable views**: Easily communicate requirements to stakeholders who don't use or understand Airtable

## Product Principles

- **Multiple perspectives**: Different views (hierarchy, graph, sunburst) reveal different insights - support them all
- **Simplicity over features**: Focus on making status and structure obvious, not on replicating Airtable's editing capabilities
- **Read from the source**: Stay in sync with Airtable as the source of truth rather than duplicating data

## Success Looks Like

- Anyone can understand project status in seconds by glancing at a visualization
- Teams make better decisions because requirements data is visible and comprehensible
- Fewer status update meetings because information is self-serve
- Product managers, developers, and stakeholders share the same understanding of requirements and progress
